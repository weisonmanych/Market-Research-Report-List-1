<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Sequencer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plate Electrophoresis</li><li>Capillary Electrophoresis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene sequencer market is primarily divided into two types: plate electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. Plate electrophoresis utilizes flat gel plates to separate DNA fragments, making it suitable for high-throughput applications. In contrast, capillary electrophoresis employs thin capillaries filled with gel, allowing for rapid separation and higher resolution. Both technologies enable accurate analysis of genetic material, but capillary electrophoresis is often preferred for its efficiency and ability to handle smaller sample sizes, making it a dominant choice in modern sequencing.</p></p>
