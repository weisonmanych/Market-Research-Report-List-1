<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Graft Alternatives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allograft</li><li>Xenograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone graft alternatives market primarily includes allografts and xenografts. Allografts are bone tissues harvested from human donors, typically used to promote healing in orthopedic and dental procedures. They provide a natural scaffold for tissue regeneration without the need for harvesting from the patient. Xenografts, on the other hand, utilize bone derived from animals, often bovine, providing biocompatibility while minimizing rejection risks. Both alternatives aim to enhance bone regeneration and support surgical outcomes, expanding options for patients and surgeons alike.</p></p>
