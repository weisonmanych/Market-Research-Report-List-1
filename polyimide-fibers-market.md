<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyimide fibers market is primarily segmented into two types based on production processes: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving polyimide polymer in a solvent, followed by extrusion into a coagulation bath, resulting in fibers with high strength and thermal stability. In contrast, dry spinning involves the evaporation of a solvent after the polymer is extruded, producing fibers that offer good mechanical properties but may have slightly different thermal characteristics. Each method serves specific industrial applications.</p></p>
